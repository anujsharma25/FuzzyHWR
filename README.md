A Python-based project that combines fuzzy feature engineering with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to recognize handwritten text. The approach leverages the uncertainty-handling capability of fuzzy logic with the structural learning power of GNNs, making the model robust to noisy, irregular, and real-world handwriting samples.

Features:
The node features have been understood in terms of fuzzy membership, which convert crisp feature vector to fuzzy based feature vector.
The fuzzy membership has been evaluated through probabilistic measure of training data and related rules further decide the boundary level features.
This work has been carried for node features in GNNs and allow GNNs to train as happen in traditional GNNs training. 
This work has been carried for important graph classification area as handwritten text recognition, where handwritten strokes are understood as graphs.
